# Introduction
This is a 2D game created with C# with XNA and Monogame. It was created for a university project in 2014 so the libraries are outdated and the game cannot be compiled or ran. 
But I was smart enough to [record a video](https://youtu.be/4gABrQuSDfo). I was never very good at playing it. I created the art in Gimp but I made it too detailed (I'm not an artist) so the collision became a little wonky in some places and I didn't have time to fix it. 

# The Game
The player controls a space ship and the goal is to collect as many jewels as possible, whilst avoiding the turrets.
At the end there is a boss (my C# lecturer who has lasers shooting out of his eyes) which you have to kite back to the turrets so that the turrets kill him.
The ship is affected by a faux gravity and you have to watch your fuel consumption. The pitch of the audio changes if you use the turbo boost.
The game uses per pixel collision, and enemies and jewels are spawned using pixel maps.
It featured a high score list which used the university's database. The code for this connection has been removed but I chose to keep the code for the high score reporting. 

This project is now 7 years old and it's messy at times. I might one day recreate it but because of the libraries used it's a fairly big task.
